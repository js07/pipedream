# Overview

The 2markdown API lets you convert rich text into Markdown format. This is especially useful within Pipedream, where you can automate the processing of text from various sources and ensure it's Markdown-ready for publishing on platforms like GitHub or your blog. This API can be a crucial part of content management workflows, where consistency in formatting is key.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email to Markdown Blog Post**: Automatically convert emails you send to a specific address into Markdown format. Then, pass that Markdown to a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo to update your blog. This enables rapid publishing from your inbox to your readers.

- **Rich Text Notes to GitHub Documentation**: If you maintain project notes in apps like Evernote or Google Docs, use 2markdown to convert these notes into Markdown. Then, automatically commit the converted text to a GitHub repository as updated documentation, ensuring your project's documentation stays current with minimal effort.

- **Slack Messages to Knowledge Base**: Convert selected Slack messages or threads into Markdown and save them into a company knowledge base or a Confluence page. This helps preserve important discussions and decisions made within your team's Slack workspace in a more permanent and organized format.
