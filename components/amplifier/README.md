# Overview

The Amplifier API allows you to marry print and fulfillment solutions with the ease of Pipedream's serverless platform. It enables the automation of merchandise operations, from inventory management to order fulfillment and shipping. With Amplifier, you can seamlessly connect your eCommerce platform, manage product catalogs, track inventory levels, and kick off fulfillment processes right when a customer places an order. Use Pipedream to build workflows that trigger based on various events, efficiently integrating Amplifier with other apps to streamline your merchandise logistics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order is placed in your eCommerce platform, such as Shopify or WooCommerce, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create an order in Amplifier. This workflow can ensure real-time order processing and fulfillment without manual intervention.

- **Inventory Level Monitoring**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to periodically check inventory levels in Amplifier. If stock for a particular item falls below a set threshold, automatically generate a restock alert or initiate a purchase order with your supplier, and even post a notification to a Slack channel to keep your team informed.

- **Customer Service Integration**: Create a workflow that combines Amplifier with a customer service platform like Zendesk. Whenever a fulfillment issue is reported, automatically create a support ticket and initiate the return or exchange process through the Amplifier API, streamlining customer resolutions.
