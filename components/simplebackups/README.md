# Overview

SimpleBackups is a robust tool for managing database and file backups across various hosting providers. Harnessing the SimpleBackups API on Pipedream, you can automate backup operations, monitor backup statuses, and integrate backup workflows with a suite of other apps and services. The API empowers you to create backups on demand, schedule them as needed, and even trigger alerts or actions based on backup outcomes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup Triggers**: Automate the process of triggering backups for critical databases before deploying new code. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for a GitHub push event and triggers a backup via SimpleBackups API before the CI/CD pipeline proceeds.

- **Backup Monitoring and Notifications**: Create a workflow where Pipedream regularly checks the status of your SimpleBackups tasks. If a backup fails, automatically send a notification through Slack or email, ensuring immediate awareness and response to any issues.

- **Backup Lifecycle Management**: Manage the lifecycle of backups by setting up a Pipedream workflow that automatically deletes old backups from storage after a certain period, keeping storage costs in check and enforcing data retention policies.
