# Overview

SheetDB is a tool that turns Google Sheets into a JSON API, which can be readily used in Pipedream to create powerful, serverless workflows. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your Google Sheets data, effectively using the spreadsheet as a flexible, no-setup database. Integrating SheetDB with Pipedream enables you to automate tasks involving spreadsheet data within a broader system of interconnected apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Inventory Management Sync**: Automate inventory tracking by connecting SheetDB with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a new order is placed on Shopify, trigger a Pipedream workflow to decrement the stock quantity in the corresponding Google Sheet through SheetDB. Conversely, when stock is updated in Google Sheets, sync these changes to Shopify to reflect the current inventory levels.

- **Lead Management System**: Combine SheetDB with a CRM platform like HubSpot to manage leads. Use Pipedream to watch for new submissions on a Google Sheet-based form. For each new submission, add or update the lead's information in HubSpot, ensuring that your sales team always has the latest data at hand.

- **Content Calendar Automation**: Integrate SheetDB with a social media management app like Buffer or Hootsuite for automated posting. Store your content calendar in Google Sheets and use Pipedream to schedule posts in advance. When itâ€™s time to publish, the workflow retrieves the post details from the Sheet via SheetDB and pushes the content to the designated social media channel.
