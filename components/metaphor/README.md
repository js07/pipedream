# Overview

The Exa API, formerly known as Metaphor, is a tool for integrating and manipulating large datasets, enabling advanced analytics and data visualization. With Exa on Pipedream, you can trigger workflows using webhook events, manipulate data streams in real time, and connect with various other services to enrich, analyze, or act upon your data. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies the process of creating complex data operations with minimal code, allowing for efficient automation and integration with hundreds of other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Enrichment**: Automatically enrich incoming data from Exa with additional information from external sources. For instance, if Exa provides user data, a Pipedream workflow can augment that data with geolocation info from the IPStack API.

- **Real-time Analytics and Reporting**: Set up a workflow that streams data from Exa to a real-time dashboard tool like Geckoboard. Each time new data is available, it can be processed and sent to update the dashboard, providing instant insights.

- **Data Sync Across Platforms**: Create a two-way data sync between Exa and a CRM platform like Salesforce. Whenever a dataset is updated in Exa, the relevant changes can be reflected in Salesforce, and vice versa, ensuring data consistency across systems.
