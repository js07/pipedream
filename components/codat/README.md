# Overview

The Codat API lets you effortlessly link and sync financial data between software and accounting platforms used by small businesses. This means you can automate data flows, consolidate financial records, or even build dashboards that give real-time insights into a company's financial health. Using Pipedream, you can harness the power of Codat's API to create workflows that trigger on specific events, move data between apps, and automate tasks that would otherwise require manual data entry or analysis.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Financial Reporting:** Consolidate financial data from multiple sources into a single report. With Pipedream, you can pull data from Codat, process it, and then push it to a Google Sheet, making it easy for stakeholders to access and analyze up-to-date financial information.

- **Real-time Expense Tracking:** Create a system that captures and categorizes expenses the moment they're recorded in any accounting software. Pipedream can listen for new transaction data from Codat and then feed it into an expense management app like Expensify or a custom database for immediate action and tracking.

- **Invoice Synchronization Across Platforms:** Sync invoices from e-commerce platforms like Shopify to accounting software like QuickBooks. Use Pipedream to watch for new sales in Shopify, then use Codat's API to push the data into QuickBooks, keeping your accounts receivable up to date with minimal effort.
