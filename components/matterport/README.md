# Overview

The Matterport API allows you to tap into the rich data of 3D spatial data, enabling developers to create immersive virtual experiences and manage large collections of 3D models programmatically. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows involving virtual tours, real estate listings, or even integrate with other business tools for a seamless data exchange.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Virtual Tour Notifications**: Trigger an email or SMS via SendGrid or Twilio when a new virtual tour is created or updated in Matterport. This can inform real estate agents or clients about tour availability, offering instant updates on property listings.

- **Sync Matterport Data with a CRM**: Automatically update customer records in Salesforce, HubSpot, or another CRM whenever a new model is added or modified in Matterport. This ensures that sales teams have the latest information on properties and can follow up on leads with the most current virtual tour links.

- **Scheduled Property Reports**: Generate and send daily or weekly reports to stakeholders summarizing the number of views and user interactions with various Matterport virtual tours. Use Google Sheets or Airtable to track and visualize this data over time, enabling informed decision-making for marketing and sales strategies.
