# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry**: Automate the process of data input into your database. When a new entry is added to a Google Sheet, trigger a workflow that uses the Icypeas API to process the data and automatically insert it into your SQL database.

- **Customer Insights**: Gain deeper insights into customer behavior. Set up a workflow that listens to Stripe payment events, sends the transaction data to the Icypeas API for analysis, and then funnels the processed data to your CRM to enrich customer profiles.

- **Real-time Data Sync**: Keep your applications in sync. When a new user signs up on your platform, use a workflow to send the user's details to the Icypeas API, which processes the information and updates a Mailchimp list for your marketing campaigns.
